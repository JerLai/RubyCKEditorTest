# RubyCKEditorTest: BlogU

Source code for a personal project in learning Ruby on Rails, and integrating CKEditor 4.x into it. This is a more bare bones project, using as many of the Ruby on Rails defaults as possible for the API and backend, and not using template slimming or minifying.

## Key Dependencies Used

* mini_magick
* galetahub/ckeditor

## Future Goals: Full Stack Project for a Blog Site

What began as learning how to implement a gem that makes it easier to integrate CKEditor 4.x into Ruby on Rails, became a vested interest in learning how to do a full-stack project for a blogging service. The plans to expand this project is as follows:

1. Create the CMS to handle posting blogs
2. Associated functionalities such as Users, Authentication, Blog Spaces (for particular types of blogs such as "Lord of the Rings")
3. Improving front end aesthetics, potentially using Vue.js
